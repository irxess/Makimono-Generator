    <h1>About Makimono</h1>
    <p>
      This project started out by that we wanted to have a place to collect, view, and not least share the recipes we like to use with our friends.
      The recipes have various origins, but mostly come from family and friends, some stuff we found online with some research (but with our own twists), and a couple originals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annoying to convert from cups every time, so wanted to save recipes.
      Also.. modifications, need a place to take notes.
      Other recipe sites did often not "flow" right, using multiple hours to preheat the oven or having a recipe that needs to rest overnight take 3 hours to complete.
      Also, wanted to avoid scrolling past someone life story to get to a recipe.
      In short, nothing seemed like the right place to get recipes from, so we made our own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recipes you will find on this site usually use metric weights as units.
      They will not have hidden steps like "shredded carrots" in the ingredient list.
      You will not have to scroll past a blog post to get to the recipe.
      Ingredient amounts are included in the recipe steps, so if you want, you can place a bowl on the kitchen weight and measure ingredients as you go.
