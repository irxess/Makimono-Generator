recipe: Oliebollen (Dutch Doughnuts)

description: "This deep fried snack is often eaten around New Years Eve. This recipe is with raisins and currants, the more common way to eat it. However, you can also add dried fruit or apple pieces instead. The oliebollen freeze extremely well. To reheat, just warm in the oven for a few minutes."
