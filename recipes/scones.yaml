     depends_on: [],
     ingredients: [ {id: 0}, {id: 1}, {id: 2}, {id: 3} ],
     long: "Mix together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar in a bowl."}
  - {id: 1, short: Add butter, time: 5, type: 'bowl', temp: 'room',
     depends_on: [0],
     ingredients: [ {id: 4} ],
     long: "Add the butter with your fingers until the mixture has a sandy texture without chunks."}
  - {id: 2, short: Mix milk and egg, time: 1, type: 'bowl', temp: 'room',
     depends_on: [],
     ingredients: [ {id: 5, amount: 100}, {id: 6} ],
     long: "In a different bowl, mix the egg with most of the milk. If desired, save a bit of the egg for an egg wash later."}
  - {id: 3, short: Mix everything, time: 2, type: 'bowl', temp: 'room',
     depends_on: [1,2],
     ingredients: [{id: 5}],
     long: "Add the milk mixture to the bowl with flour. Mix until it becomes a relatively smooth ball, but try to
     avoid kneading the dough too much. The dough should come together without being sticky.
     Add more of the milk if the dough still is crumbly.
     If it does end up sticky, add a bit more flour, so the dough is easier to handle.
     However, be careful when adjusting the milk and flour ratio, as you want to knead the dough as little as possible."}
  - {id: 4, short: Preheat oven, time: 0, type: 'oven', temp: 'room',
     depends_on: [],
     long: "Preheat the oven to 200 degrees Celsius."}
  - {id: 5, short: Shape, time: 6, type: 'shape', temp: 'room',
     depends_on: [3],
     long: "Roll the dough until it is about 1-2 cm thick. Cut out circles of the desired size and transfer them onto a baking sheet."}
  - {id: 6, short: Bake, time: 14, type: 'oven', temp: 'hot',
     depends_on: [4, 5],
     long: "Put the scones into the oven, and bake at 200 degrees C with convection on. The scones
     are done when they have a nice, golden color on top. This should take about 14 minutes."}
