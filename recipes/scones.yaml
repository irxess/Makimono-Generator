    short: Mix everything,
    long: "Add the milk mixture to the bowl with flour. Mix until it becomes a relatively smooth ball, but try to avoid kneading the dough too much. The dough should come together without being sticky. Add more of the milk if the dough still is crumbly. If it does end up sticky, add a bit more flour, so the dough is easier to handle. However, be careful when adjusting the milk and flour ratio, as you want to knead the dough as little as possible.",
