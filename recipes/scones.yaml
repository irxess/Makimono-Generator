steps:

      { name: all-purpose flour, amount: 280, unit: 'g'},
      { name: baking powder, amount: 16, unit: 'g'},

    short: Add butter,
    long: "Add the butter with your fingers until the mixture has a sandy texture without chunks.",

  - {
    short: Mix milk and egg,
    long: "In a different bowl, mix the egg with most of the milk. If desired, save a bit of the egg for an egg wash later.",

  - {
    short: Mix everything,
    long: "Add the milk mixture to the bowl with flour. Mix until it becomes a relatively smooth ball, but try to avoid kneading the dough too much. The dough should come together without being sticky. Add more of the milk if the dough still is crumbly. If it does end up sticky, add a bit more flour, so the dough is easier to handle. However, be careful when adjusting the milk and flour ratio, as you want to knead the dough as little as possible.",

    short: Shape,
    long: "Roll the dough until it is about 1-2 cm thick. Cut out circles of the desired size and transfer them onto a baking sheet. I usually roll out the dough to cut out 5 scones, then roll out the rest for two more, and make one with the left-overs from that.",
