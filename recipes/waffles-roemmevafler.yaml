recipe: "Waffles – Rømmevafler"

description: "The alternative Norwegian style of waffles where you use rømme (cultured sour cream) as the main liquid for the dough. Beware that you can get several varietes of rømme these days, and although they are similar in texture and taste, the reduced fat version tend to have a more sour after-taste and less smooth texture the lower the fat content."
