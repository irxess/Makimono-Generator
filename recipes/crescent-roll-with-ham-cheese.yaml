recipe: Crescent Rolls with Ham and Cheese

description: "An easy, neutral yeast-dough which can be combined with many different fillings. This variant is based on a Norwegian horn-recipe. These small rolls are best when they're still warm - but don't eat them right out of the oven, or you will burn yourself."
