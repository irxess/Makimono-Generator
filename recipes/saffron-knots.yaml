    Then take the dough out of the kitchen machine bowl, and put it somewhere to rest.",

    Put the shaped knots onto sheets of baking paper to rest. Make sure to have some distance between the knots, as they will
    expand both while proofing and in the oven.",

eating: These knots taste better when they're a bit warm, so I recommend heating them in the microwave.
