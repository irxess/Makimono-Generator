The balls will melt into half-peaches in the oven. Check for brownness beneath them to determin whether they're done. They should have a medium-light brownness, not be dark.",

Then, take a brush and paint some on the peaches, or just roll the peaches in the coloring a bit. Beware that for this recipe you should not use regular food coloring, but rather the cheap watery kind you find in convenience stores. After you have colored each peach, grently roll it around in some sugar to coat it. If you're not coloring them, you should moisturize the peaches in some other way before rolling them in the sugar. You could for instance use some water, or leftovers of the peach alcohol.",
