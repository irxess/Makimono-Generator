recipe: Sichuan Boiled Fish

description: "An extremely spicy dish, yet rich in flavor. For the best results, try making the sichuan chili oil yourself (recipe is linked from the ingredients overview). As a serving suggestion we like to have a bowl of rich creamy ice cream on the side to allow us to enjoy even more of it when we fist make it (did I mention that it's very spicy?)."

However, you should only go as thing as you are comfortable with, as you don't want the pieces to tear apart as you're cutting them either. To make it easier, try to cut diagonally. If you are familiar with it, the result should look like sashimi pieces.",
    ingredients: [ {name: White fish, amount: 300, unit: g, comment: "Use filets if you want to keep things simple. The actual type of fish that seems to be more commonly used in China is Pangasius bocourti (found no other name in English). Can be substituted for other white fish that might be easier to get a hold of where you live, such as tilapia or wolffish. It's no problem to buy the fish frozen, actually you might find it easier to work with the fish when it's partially frozen."} ],
