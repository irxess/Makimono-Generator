You can use a bowl if you're most comfortable with that, I just to it on the cutting board I used previously because I find it easier to mix with my hands on the open surface, and you'll need something to shape the burgers on later anyways.",

    long: "It's time to fry the burgers! I like my burgers fried swiftly over high heat to get a nice crust while preserving a juicy inside. Make sure to prepare somewhere to place the burgers as they come out of the pan and you want to put new ones in. If you are making really many you can consider placing the finished ones in the oven under some aluminum foil at about 50 C. Optionally, add cheese after turning them to maximize melting time.",
