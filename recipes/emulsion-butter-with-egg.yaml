I like to use the standard Norwegian butter unclarified, which is salted (approximately 1.1% salt) and sligtly accidic. Note that the base recipe here calls for 85 g butter per egg yolk, but I've seen other recipes go as high as 115 g butter per yolk, so there should be room for some variance here.",

Things I've tried that works well are estragon/tarragon, black pepper, ramsons/wild garlic (Allium ursinum). If you use unsalted butter, also add a pinch of salt. I guesstimate that between 0.5 to 1 tsp is a fine amount for the base recipe, this step is mostly added to ease scaling the recipe.",
