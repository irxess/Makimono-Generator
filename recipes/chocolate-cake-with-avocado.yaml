recipe: Chocolate Cake with Avocado

description: "A delicious and moist chocolate cake, that's reasonably simple to make. For those days that you don't feel like making brownies because you want something more firm, cake, but you still want the depth of chocolate and non-dryness you typically see in brownies. The original recipe details how you could make it gluten free as well as vegan."
