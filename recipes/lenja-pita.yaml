    short: "Fry the apples",
    long: "This has two purposes. Firstly it will draw out water from the apples, so that the dough around the apples doesn't become soggy. Secondly, depending on how finely you chopped the apples, they will become very soft, perhaps almost a smooth mass. It also helps the sugar and spices draw a bit better in. Depending on your frying pan you might need some fat to make this go smoother, in which case I recoment using some butter. One tbsp of butter is about 15 g.",
